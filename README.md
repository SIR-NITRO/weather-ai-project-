# weather-ai-project/
Overall Goal Build an end-to-end AI project that: - Analyzes historical weather data - like the seasonal data (temperature, rainfall) to see which variables correlate most - Visualizes trends and patterns - observe the  trend charts and abnormal weather periods. - Predicts short-term weather variables - train-test split, model train, prediction and evaluate (using MAE & MSE).
# Weather Prediction ML Project

This project predicts weather using machine learning.
